# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
I was motivated to learn about what goes into creating your own website and the different elements that go into it and how to use different coding languages. It has taught me the basic fundamentals of coding and the building blocks to make a website such as interactivity with JavaScript and HTML for the frame. I am able to refer to this study guide to learn definitions and notes. I leaned how to share work through github and how to identify problems that may arise when building code.
